Things to keep in mind before changing configurational changes :-

1.Where to change
2.Backup
3.How to change
4.Try ( or ) experiment in local environment
5.Documentation

Snapshot / Backup :-
 *server.xml_history ( this will have the snapshot )
For wildfly - configuration --> Home folder of wildfly --> standalone --> configuration --> standalone.xml_history

File name : Standlone.v1
eg:-port number change 
standalone-port change.v2 
Need to rename the original or existed different status of the artifacts deployed in wildfly . In wildfly deployed artifacts can have various 
ststaus ststess including 


Key Deployment Status in WildFly:
Deployed:
The application is successfully deployed and running on the WildFly server.
 
Undeployed:
The application has been removed from the server and is not currently running. 
Deployment process encountered an error and the application is not running.
 
Starting:
The application is currently being initialized and is not yet fully available.
 
Stopping:
The application is in the process of being gracefully shut down.
 
Suspended:
The application is temporarily paused and not actively processing requests.
 
Redeploying:
An existing deployed application is being updated with new code and re-deployed.
 
How to Check Deployment Status:
WildFly Management Console: Access the WildFly management console through a web interface to view the deployment status of all applications.
Command Line: Use the WildFly CLI to query the status of individual deployments. 

Accessing deployment status:
 
wild fly management console:
 
you can view the status of deployed artifacts through the wildfly admin console which provides a list of deployments with their current state.
 
CLI(command Line Interface):

using the wildfly command-line interface you can query the status of deployments with management commands
 
indicating whether the application is currently running not deployed encountered an error during deployment,intentionally de activated temporarily paused or is in the process

of being redeployed with updates

Domain & host controller in wildfly :-

In JBoss WildFly, a "domain controller" acts as the central management point for a group of servers within a domain, overseeing configuration changes and ensuring consistency across all servers, while a "host controller" is responsible for managing the individual application server instances running on a specific host machine, communicating with the domain controller to apply configuration updates and start/stop server processes on that host. 

Key points about domain and host controllers:

Domain controller:- *Acts as the contral manager points for the entire domain 
                   *Stores and domain wide configuration in a file called "domain.xml"
                  (Home folder -->domain -->configuration -->domain.xml)
                   *Respondible for distributing configuration changes to all host controllers within the domain 

Host controller:- *manages the application server instances running on a specific host 
                  *Read its configuration from a host.xml file specific to that host 
                 (Home folder -->domain -->configuration -->host.xml)
                  *Communicates with the domain controller to receive configuration updates and start/stop server instances 

  { Domaion is represented to master centralised "DCHC" where we can manage other wildfly serves
